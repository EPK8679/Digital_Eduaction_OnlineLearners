#Digital_Eduaction_OnlineLearners
An online course built by the Digital Education Service has been running on a partner
platform for over a year. Datasets are available for download off the backend of the platform.
The Digital Education Service and the Course Instructor are interested in knowing how many
participants have enrolled as learners on the course and how many have completed the
course each month for one year of running the course. Course completers are defined as
having completed, passed and verified their identification.
Represent the answers to question 1 and 2 on the same data visualisation of your choice.
Provide a brief narrative describing the data in the visualisation, highlighting trends and any
points of interest.
1. How many unique course participants became learners on the course each month
between the period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 inclusive? Include the frequency table
in the report.
2. How many unique course participants completed the course each month between the
period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 inclusive? Include the frequency table in the
report.
The Course Instructor wants information on the employment status of participants who
completed the course between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019 to understand more about
the ‘type’ of participant who is completing the course.
3. Visually represent the proportion of the course completers that make up each
employment group provided in the dataset. Provide a brief narrative describing the data
in the visualisation and highlighting any points of interest.
