# Digital_Eduaction_OnlineLearners
Report

Over the course of a year, Digital Education Service had been running an online course with the help of a partner. This analysis will help to understand the outcome of the online course, the present status of the course completers and how the course helped them. The period of analysis is from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019. 

Various factors considered for the analysis are, the number of learner enrollees each month, number of course completers each month and a study based on the employment status of completers. Splitting the participants based on employment will also help in reviewing the content of the course and if any subject specific to any employment group is to be added or emphasized. 

Analysis on conversion rate of participants to learners & completers: 
Below table shows an analysis for the period on the monthly number of course participants who have 
(i)	Enrolled as learners. 
(ii)	Completed the course.
 
Over the course of a year, the average number of learners who joined was 1293, and the average number of learners who completed the course was 130, as derived from the table above.,

 
The graph shows that, in terms of course enrollees, the number of students finishing the course and validating their identity is quite low. For example, in the month of 2018-10, 2689 students enrolled, but only 118 students completed the course, accounting for just 5% of the total enrollees. The graph also reveals that, the number of learners enrolling in the online course is gradually decreasing from 2018 to 2019. Attention is sought to the higher number of learners during the period 2018-07 to 2019-01, with figures above 1000, which then drops below 1000 learners except for the month of 2019-05. 

Coming to the trend of course completion, it was noted that the trend remained same over the period. The month of 2019-01 has the highest number of successful course completers at 522.

Analysis of employment status of course completers: 
Shown below are the numbers of learners who have completed the course from various employment groups. 
  

The pie chart clearly shows that 74 percent of course completers are employed or self-employed full time, demonstrating that learners are successful in finding jobs with the help of the online course conducted by DES. Further, the course has helped in improving the key skills and confidence of each participant, as around 11 percent of the completers are presently self-employed. 

The analysis clearly shows that the course has been a success and has helped participants in; obtaining full-time work, boosting their technical skills for starting a business, and has given a general idea on the subjects covered, to the course learners. 

The main insights to analyse the study in future for enhancing the online course are the following, 

1.	Reason for low conversion from learners to course completion. 
2.	Reason for conversion rate to completers remaining same and not improving. 
3.	Basis above, is any review/change required in course content/structure. 
4.	Any change suggested as per the employment status chart to suit various groups.
